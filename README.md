# UFOs
## Overview of Project
> The purpose of this project is to create a website that can filter through UFO data based on mutiple fields and dates
## Results
> !["Website"](https://github.com/rulamia/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Website-Capture.PNG)
> The way to perform a search on the site is to fill out the filter search field. You could fill out eaach bos o get an exact portion of data back, or just filter on one alone to get a wider search. The search terms have to match exactly to how they are in the databse or the results will come up empty. To get an idea of what to type, look on the right side of the screen (or below the filter search depending on your screen size).

## Summary
### Biggest Drawback
> The biggest drawback for this web project is that the filter section has to be exact for the function to work.

### Future Updgrades
> - Replace the filter sytem of manually typing in the filter terms to be a drop down based on the terms in the data.js file.
> - Have a dedicated "Show All" button instead of having all the results visable at the start to make the wabpage cleaner looking. 
> - Be able to choose a date range istead of one single date.
